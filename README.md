PROJECT NAME: checkers 2 players.

DESCRIPTION:
This is a game of checkers for 2 human players.

Game rules:
1.	First move can be made by either player.
2.	Pawn can “eat” first opponent checker only forward. Consecutive “eats” can be backwards.
3.	Queen is allowed to move to all directions, and can make long runs in the same direction.
4.	If 15 consecutive moves are made only by queens, and without an “eat”, game ends in a tie.
5.	“Burned” rule is off. Although checkers that can make an “eat” are marked with a red halo, hence the “burned”
    rule can be applied with minor code modifications.
